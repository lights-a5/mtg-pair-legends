My playgroup was shootin' the breeze and we were speculating what would happen if we gave 'partner with' to certain legendary creatures. I am studying Software Engineering and this semester I'm not taking any CS courses that require programming. So, to keep myself sharp, I spent about 30-40 minutes creating this little Python program that would partner all the legendary creatures.

There are bugs that I haven't bothered to fix. It thinks that "Brisela" is it's own card and it gets paired. Also, the flip cards that start as non-legendary creatures and flip into legendary creatures are unfortunately included as well.

If people like it I'll implement fixes, make it more robust, and implement additional features that people want, but I don't imagine people really digging it. I wrote it for my own amusement and just thought I'd share it.

To run it, you will need python 3 and the libraries "scrython" and "ratelimiter".
